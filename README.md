# Biological Tissue Image Classification
This repository contains my submission from March 2024 for a Deep Learning image classificaiton assignment for my Msc. Data Science and Society at Tilburg University. The assignment concerned classification of tissue images into 1 of 5 classes, distinguishing between type of tissue (lung vs. colon) and type of tumor (malignant vs. benign).

### Sample images

### Loss and accuracy through training of the CNN
